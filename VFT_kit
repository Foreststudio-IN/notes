Hi,
Hope your contents reached safe.

The list of your contents should be :
1. Packet of seeds,
2. Pot filled with sphagnum moss.

The procedure is quiet simple, if you follow the steps below.

1. Soak the VFT seeds in drinking water ( at room temperature ) and not tap water ( any water source with salt less than 50 ppm on a tds scale ) for 24 hours.

2. If you would have also purchased the GA3 pack, you can weigh 0.01gms and dissolve in the water (10ml) you would be soaking the seeds in.

3. Once the seeds are soaked, scrb your hands with soap and dry them. Use your finger to gently pick the seeds after draining the water and place them on the top of the moss in your pot.

4. Please repeat the process till the seeds are done and once they are done, gently shift the pot into a zip lock cover. Goal is to let light in but also to maintain a high humidity.

5. Pour 50ml of water in the cover and seal the mouth of it.

6. Place this at a east facing window or balcony where the setting sun falls on them.

7. In less than 6 weeks you will notice sprouts.

8. Do not repot them until your respective specie has attained a maturity size.

9. After 2 months you can leave a small gap in the mouth of the zip loak cover. Till then you dont have to water it. 

10. if you have any other doubts , pl ping me.


Stay Safe.
