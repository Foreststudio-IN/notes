This is to help you understand how to care for a low land or a low land hybrid nepenthes plant.

### 1. If you just got the plant, gently unpack them, use driking water (less than 75-100 ppm) and pour water through the leaves and wet the pot 
till water pours down the drain holes and leave them be over night.

### 2. Spare day 2 without watering. Do not keep the plant in full sun as it will put them into shock from the shipment's stress.
PS These plants can be very sensitive as their senses drive them to pray on their food.

### 3. Place them towards the west sun setting side of your place. Do not expose them to full sun, they will require atleast 2 hours of direct sun.
They love rain and if it rains please feel free to let rain water spill on them.

### 4. Do not move the plant if kept at a place. They dont like changes.

### 5. Do not feed the plant, they have to make sure that they can get their own food sourced with the aromatic pheromones they produce to lure insects.

### 6. Do not add fertilizers, soil, manure, or any other substance than what the plant comes with. If there is a spill of medium, feel free to add fresh and clean cocopeat that has been rinsed away from factory additives. 

### 7. If you already grow orchids with some sort of expertise, you probably have a good sense of care required for nepenthes, a 50% conc. orchid fert(water sluble npk) spray every week can help them grow wild after you've destressed the plant from shipment.

### 8. The plant will need a physical support after it has grown more than 1/2 ft. The leaves are heavy and will bend the entire plant, this can cause the plant to snap or break with heavy winds, its safer to tie a pole with the plant for the support.

### 9. These plants have seperate male and female gender to them, a plant can only be one gender which you will know only when it flowers by classifiying the flower's anatomy. They are Monoecious and not polygamous in nature. So if you need seeds of your plant, you've got to cross with another nepenthes of the oppsite gender, there are several facebook groups and social circles we maintain that help circulate pollen grains to female plants.

### 10. Physical conditions : Temperature range 20 - 45 Degrees Centigrade, humidity above 60% ( spray water on them 3-4 a day on the leaves if its warm, else once if its cold)
